# Loss Testing

## Description

This application helps to detect transient outages on data center links that are often difficult to detect by other detection tools, and the ACI provides atomic counter as a telemetry method that can locate and graphically display it.

This program was developed in 2018 and is now open to the public after being authorized by users. However, this program has not been tested in the version above APIC 2.2.This issue will be addressed in a subsequent release update.

## Installation

The application dosen't need to install. It's a python script directly running in your python environment.

## Environment

Required <br>
* Python 3+ <br>
* ACI and compatible ACI Cobra SDK (e.g. support microsegmentation feature of ACI) <br>
* A standard TKinter  library installed <br>
